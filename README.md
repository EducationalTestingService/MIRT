# MIRT
A general program for item-response analysis is described which uses the stabilized Newton-Raphson algorithm. This program is written to be compliant with Fortran 2003 standards and is sufficiently general to handle independent variables, multidimensional ability parameters,
and matrix sampling. The ability variables may be either polytomous or multivariate normal. Items may be dichotomous or polytomous.

Please see irtprogram.pdf for details of the program.
